# Bootstrap Studio
   
Bootstrap Studio is a proprietary `web design` and `development` application. It offers a large number of components for building `responsive pages` including `headers`, `footers`, `galleries` and `slideshows` along with basic elements such as `spans` and `divs`. The program can be used for building `websites` and `prototypes`.
